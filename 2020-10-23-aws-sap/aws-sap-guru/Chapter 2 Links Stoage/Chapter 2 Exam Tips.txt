Here are my exam tips
for the storage module.
The most important thing I can recommend
is be sure to read the AWS Storage Options whitepaper
and note the anti-patterns in that particular paper.
You really need a solid understanding
of when to use various data stores,
for instance, when the question asks for
an OLTP or ACID-compliant data store,
then RDS is your answer.
If it talks about storing blobs, then S3 is the best choice,
and if it mentions something about
needing complete control over the database
then that should lead you to the EC2 option.
Now in each chapter,
I've assembled some resources for further study
and they come in two flavors,
AWS Whitepapers and re:Invent videos.
Now the whitepapers are absolutely required,
there will be questions on the exam
and in my quizzes and in the exam simulator
that come straight out of the whitepapers.
So you really wanna read those.
The re:Invent videos are optional
but they're recommended for maximum badassery.
The reason I recommend that you watch those re:Invent videos
is a lot of times the speakers will use case studies
and they'll talk about real-world examples
of stuff that maybe applies directly
to what you're trying to do.
So it's definitely a good learning tool
to hear about how other people solve problems.
But if you're short on time,
you can probably safely skip them
in the context of the exam.
The exam won't have questions
that'll be sourced from re:Invent videos,
rather, question material will come from
whitepapers documentation and best practices.
The resources are gonna be off on the left hand side
if you happen to be watching this in a browser
or if you happen to be watching this content
on a mobile device, they'll be down below in portrait mode.
Now we update these links every so often
as AWS has new versions of whitepapers
or they publish new videos.
So always be sure to use the hyperlinks here.
