## Problems 771 [Jewels and Stones](https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/)

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
Note:

S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.

```
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        int res = 0;
        Set set = new HashSet();
        for(char c : J.toCharArray())
            set.add(c);
        for(char s: S.toCharArray())
            if(set.contains(s))
                res++;
        return res;
    }
}
```

quotation [Thinking In Java]

set.add(c);

>Adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present 
>(optional operation). More formally, adds the specified element e to this >set if the set contains no element e2 such that (e==null ? e2==null : >e.equals(e2)). If this set already contains the element, the call leaves >the set unchanged and returns false. In combination with the restriction >on constructors, this ensures that sets never contain duplicate elements.
set has no duplicate element or elemenet that's null
