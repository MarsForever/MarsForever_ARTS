## Problems 771 [Jewels and Stones](https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/)

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
Note:

S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.

```
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        int res = 0;
        Set set = new HashSet();
        for(char c : J.toCharArray())
            set.add(c);
        for(char s: S.toCharArray())
            if(set.contains(s))
                res++;
        return res;
    }
}
```
This is some information about set container.

set.add(c);

>Adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present 
(optional operation). More formally, adds the specified element e to this set if the set contains no element e2 such that (e==null ? e2==null : e.equals(e2)). If this set already contains the element, the call leaves the set unchanged and returns false. In combination with the restriction on constructors, this ensures that sets never contain duplicate elements.

set has no duplicate element or elemenet that's null

>Returns true if this set contains the specified element. More formally, returns true if and only if this set contains an element e such that (o==null ? e==null : o.equals(e)).

if o equals to null,then returns the boolean that e equlas to null.
if o doesn't equals to null,then returns the boolean that o equals to e.

# Tip
根据耗子叔写的博客
[如何免费的让网站启用HTTPS](https://coolshell.cn/articles/18094.html)

根据下面的操作提示尝试了把自己的博客从http变成了https

https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntuxenial-apache

后来发现结果并不理想,在chrome上会出现`net::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID`错误
后来换成root后执行了下面的命令行，效果喜人。
感觉是sudo 执行和变成root以后再执行下面的命令行的实际效果并不一样。

`certbot --apache -vvvv -d www.marsforever.com -d marsforever.com`
