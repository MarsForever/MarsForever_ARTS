• Whitepaper: Practicing Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery on AWS: Accelerating Software Delivery with DevOps

• Whitepaper: Microservices on AWS

• Whitepaper: Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes

• AWS Documentation

• AWS Architecture Center

• https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Storage/BackupandRecoveryApproachesUsing_AWS.pdf

Ready all the core subjects FAQ’s 

I watched all of the following reinvent videos:

Completed all the Wizlabs. & Braincert AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional Practice Exams [Highly Recommended] – These practice exam allowed me to understand how to breakdown the questions, work on my speed and reach in depth to understand the recommended answer!.

https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheets/ and dojo practice exams. I found Braincert and Wizlabs more comprehensive then dojo exams.

• Understand VPC Endpoints (hint: know how to restrict access on S3 to specific VPC Endpoint)

• Understand VPC Peering

• Route 53: Routing Policies and their use cases Focus on Weighted, Latency routing policies

• Understand CloudFront and use cases (hint : S3 caching)

• Understand API Gateway and exposed microservices within the AWS network

#### Keyword

- DR:RPO/RTO
  - RPO(Recovery Point Objective):恢复点目标。The time between when a disaster occurs and the last recoverable copy of key business data was created. Minimize the length of this time period(via regular backups, snapshots, and transaction logs) to avoid business disruptive(破坏的) data loss.
  - RTO(Recovery Time Objective):恢复时间目标。The time between when a disaster occurs and when the system can be restored to an operational(即可使用的) state and handed over to the business for testing. Improve this by decreasing restore time, having hot spares(热后备) tested and ready to use, and enforcing efficient processes.
- HA(High Availability):高可用性。例子：汽车备胎
- FT(Fault Tolerance):容错，故障容差。飞机两侧都有两个引擎，两侧中的一个故障都不影响飞行
- DR(Disaster Recovery):灾难恢复。战斗机上的驾驶员紧急弹射。
- Data Persistence
  - Ephemeral Storage(临时)：Instance Store Volume,Amazon ElasticCache
  - Transient Storage(暂态存储)：Simple  Queue
  - Persistent(持久存储)：Amazon EBS,Amazon EFS
- [7-Layer OSI Model ](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/OSI_model)
  - 1 - Physical :01010101
  - 2 - Data Link: ae:43:4f(MAC address)
  - 3 - Network: 10.0.0.1(IP)
  - 4 - Transport : TCP&UDP
  - 5 - Session: Port 443
  - 6 - Presentation: LoadBalancer ?
  - 7 - Application: HTTP

##### Service

If an instance reboots, the data in the instance store persists. If an instance stops, terminates, or the underlying disk(基本磁盘) fails, the data in the instance is lost.
