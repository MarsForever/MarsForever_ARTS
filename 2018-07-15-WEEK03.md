## Problems 709. [To Lower Case](https://leetcode.com/problems/to-lower-case/)

>Implement function ToLowerCase() that has a string parameter str, and returns the same string in lowercase.

```java
class Solution {
    public String toLowerCase(String str) {
        return str.toLowerCase();
    }
}
```

## Problems 796. [Rotate String](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-string/)

>We are given two strings, A and B.
>A shift on A consists of taking string A and moving the leftmost character to the rightmost position. For example, if A = 'abcde', then it will be 'bcdea' after one shift on A. Return True if and only if A can become B after some number of shifts on A.

```java
import java.util.regex.Pattern;
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
class Solution {
    public boolean rotateString(String A, String B) {
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(".*"+B+".*");
        String AA = A + A;
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(AA);
        return (A.length() == B.length() && 
               matcher.matches());
    }
}
```

I don't know how to slove it. So I search it using google.
And there is a solution(LeetCode's Discuss) is so smart.
I used `matcher` to instead of C++'s `find()` class.

Many people said they want to learn about CSAPP(15-213/18-213: Introduction to Computer Systems
)

And there is the resource(pdf,video,) at online,you can refer to the blow.

You can learn something from the cmu's online course,but there is not the same to who are learning at cmu.
So you can use google(search for:csapp online book) and learn something from some books.
