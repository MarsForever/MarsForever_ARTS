### 3.The source code of the course

I know that it will be helpful to solve problems, follow the course closely and even follow class by class the evolution of the code.

For this, a repository in Github is handy, where you have class by class each advance made in each microservice created during the course.

Each microservice has its repository, and here I share them:

- Authors' Microservice: https://github.com/JuanDMeGon/Microservices-with-Lumen_Authors
- Books' Microservice: https://github.com/JuanDMeGon/Microservices-with-Lumen_Books
- The API Gateway: https://github.com/JuanDMeGon/Microservices-with-Lumen_Gateway

I hope this helps a lot. Of course, any additional question or comment I will be here :)
