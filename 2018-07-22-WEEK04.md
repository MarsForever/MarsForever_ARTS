Problems 807. [807. Max Increase to Keep City Skyline
](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-increase-to-keep-city-skyline/description/)
>In a 2 dimensional array grid, each value grid[i][j] represents the height of a building located there. We are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings, by any amount (the amounts can be different for different buildings). Height 0 is considered to be a building as well.
>At the end, the "skyline" when viewed from all four directions of the grid, i.e. top, bottom, left, and right, must be the same as the skyline of the original grid. A city's skyline is the outer contour of the rectangles formed by all the buildings when viewed from a distance. See the following example.
>What is the maximum total sum that the height of the buildings can be increased?

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxIncreaseKeepingSkyline(int[][] grid) {
            int[] lrSkyline=new int[grid.length];
	        int[] tbSkyline=new int[grid.length];
	        
	        for(int i=0; i<grid.length; i++){
	        	lrSkyline[i]=grid[i][0];
	            for(int j=0; j<grid.length-1; j++){
	                if(lrSkyline[i] < grid[i][j+1])
	                    lrSkyline[i] = grid[i][j+1];
	            }
	        }
	        for(int j=0; j<grid.length; j++){
	        	tbSkyline[j]=grid[0][j];
	            for(int i=0; i<grid.length-1; i++){
	                if(tbSkyline[j] < grid[i+1][j])
	                    tbSkyline[j]=grid[i+1][j];
	            }
	        }
	     
	        int count=0;
	        for(int i=0; i<grid.length; i++){
	            for(int j=0; j<grid.length; j++){
	                count+= lrSkyline[i] < tbSkyline[j] ? (lrSkyline[i]-grid[i][j]) : (tbSkyline[j]-grid[i][j]);
	            }
	        }
	        return count;

    }
}

## Something about main() method

public static void main(String[] args) is Java program's entrance method.

When JVM excutes program,it will look for main() method at first.

1.In java ,you can use public static or static public.

static public void main(String[] args)

2.You can name the argument anything you want, but most programmers choose "args" or "argv".

public static final void main(String[] argv)

3.Define main() as final

public static final void main(String[] args)

4.synchronized with main() method

public static cynchronized void main(String[] args)
